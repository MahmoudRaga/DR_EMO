My Graduation Project
The integration of web technology with prediction and classification techniques has greatly impacted the field of medical patient data analysis. With the vast amounts of patient data available online, it has become increasingly important to develop efficient and effective methods for analyzing this data to make accurate predictions and classifications.
Therefore, we have created this website based on artificial intelligence techniques, which predict whether a person is ill with breast cancer and heart attacks or not.
With the help of this project, we aim to early detect many diseases, such as heart attacks and breast cancer, with an efficiency of up to 97%, to help both the doctor and the patient, and thus he will have a better chance of recovery. Treatment, improving the condition and avoiding serious complications.
Which leads to reducing the number of deaths resulting from these diseases.
We also aim to help pharmaceutical companies identify
Medication ratios in hospitals to achieve treatment equivalence.
